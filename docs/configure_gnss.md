The ZED-F9P is immensely configurable. The RTK device will, by default, put the ZED-F9P into the most common configuration for rover/base RTK for use with *SW Maps* and other GIS applications. 

The GNSS Configuration menu allows a user to change the report rate, dynamic model, and select which constellations should be used for fix calculations.

From the main menu, pressing 1 will bring up the GNSS configuration menu.

## Measurement Frequency

Measurement Frequency can be set by either Hz or by seconds between measurements. Some users need many measurements per second; RTK devices support up to 20Hz with RTK enabled. Some users are doing very long static surveys that require many seconds between measurements; the ZED-F9P supports up to 8255 seconds (137 minutes) between readings.

Note: When in **Base** mode, the measurement frequency is set to 1Hz. This is because RTK transmission does not benefit from faster updates, nor does logging of RAWX for PPP.

## Dynamic Model

The Dynamic Model can be changed but it is recommended to leave it as *Portable*. For more information, please refer to the [ZED-F9P Integration Manual](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/8/5/7/ZED-F9P_IntegrationManual__UBX-18010802_.pdf).

## Constellations Menu

[![Enable or disable the constellations used for fixes](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/2/1/8/8/SparkFun_RTK_ExpressPlus_Receiver_Constellations.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/2/1/8/8/SparkFun_RTK_ExpressPlus_Receiver_Constellations.jpg)

*Enable or disable the constellations used for fixes*

The ZED-F9P is capable of tracking 184 channels across four constellations and two bands (L1/L2) including GPS (USA), Galileo (EU), BeiDou (China), and GLONASS (Russia). SBAS (satellite-based augmentation system) is also supported. By default, all constellations are used. Some users may want to study, log, or monitor a subset. Disabling a constellation will cause the ZED to ignore those signals when calculating a location fix.

## NTRIP Client

[![NTRIP Client enabled showing settings](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/2/1/8/8/SparkFun_RTK_ExpressPlus_ReceiverNTRIP.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/2/1/8/8/SparkFun_RTK_ExpressPlus_ReceiverNTRIP.jpg)

*NTRIP Client enabled showing settings*

The SparkFun RTK devices can obtain their correction data over a few different methods. For detailed information see [Correction Sources](https://docs.sparkfun.com/SparkFun_RTK_Firmware/correction_sources/).

* Bluetooth - This is the most common. An app running on a tablet or phone has an NTRIP client built into it. Once the phone is connected over Bluetooth SPP, the RTCM is sent from the phone to the RTK device.
* Radio - A base RTK unit and a rover have serial radios plugged into the **RADIO** port. RTCM data generated by the base station is set over the radio to the rover.
* WiFi - The rover uses WiFi to be an NTRIP Client and connect to an NTRIP Caster. By enabling NTRIP Client, the RTK device will *disable* Bluetooth and instead use WiFi to connect to the caster of your choice. This is helpful in situations where a 'headless' system (no phone or tablet) is needed and the rover will be near a WiFi access point.

Once the NTRIP Client is enabled you will need a handful of credentials:

* Local WiFi SSID and password (WPA2)
* A casting service and port such as [RTK2Go](http://rtk2go.com/) or [Emlid](https://emlid.com/ntrip-caster/) (the port is almost always 2101)
* A mount point and password

With these credentials set, the RTK device will attempt to connect to WiFi, then connect to your caster of choice, and then begin downloading the RTCM data over WiFi. We tried to make it as easy as possible. Every second a few hundred bytes, up to ~2k, will be downloaded from the mount point you've entered. Remember, the rover must be in WiFi range to connect in this mode.

*Rover with Active NTRIP Client Connection*

Once the device connects to WiFi, it will attempt to connect to the user's chosen NTRIP Caster. If WiFi or the NTRIP connection fails, the rover will return to normal operation.
