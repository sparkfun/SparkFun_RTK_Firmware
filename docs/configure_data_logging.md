## WiFi Interface

Because of the nature of these controls, the AP config page is different than the terminal menu.

### Log to SD

If a microSD card is detected, all messages will be logged.

### Max Log Time

Once the max log time is achieved, logging will cease. This is useful for limiting long term, overnight, static surveys to a certain length of time. Default: 1440 minutes (24 hours). Limit: 1 to 2880 minutes.

### Max Log Length

Every 'max long length' amount of time the current log will be closed and a new log will be started. This is known as cyclic logging and is convenient on *very* long surveys (ie, months or years) to prevent logs from getting too unwieldy and helps limit the risk of log corruption. This will continue until the unit is powered down or the *max logging time* is reached.

### Enable Factory Defaults

Factory Defaults will erase any user settings and reset the internal receiver to stock settings. Any logs on SD are maintained. To prevent accidental reset the checkbox must first be checked before the button is pressed.

### SD Card

Various stats for the SD card are shown.

### Update Firmware

New firmware may be uploaded via WiFi to the unit. See [Updateing Firmware from the SD Card](https://sparkfun.github.io/SparkFun_RTK_Firmware/firmware_update/#updating-firmware-from-the-sd-card) for more information.

### Reset Counter

A counter is displayed indicating the number of non-power-on-resets since the last power on.

## Terminal Interface

*RTK Data Logging Configuration Menu*

From the Main Menu, pressing 5 will enter the Logging Menu. This menu will report the status of the microSD card. While you can enable logging, you cannot begin logging until a microSD card is inserted. Any FAT16 or FAT32 formatted microSD card up to 32GB will work. We regularly use the [SparkX brand 1GB cards](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15107) but note that these log files can get very large (>500MB) so plan accordingly.

* Option 1 will enable/disable logging. If logging is enabled, all messages from the ZED-F9P will be recorded to microSD. A log file is created at power on with the format *SFE_[DeviceName]_YYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt* based on current GPS data/time. The `[DeviceName]` is Surveyor, Express, etc.
* Option 2 allows a user to set the max logging time. This is convenient to determine the location of a fixed antenna or a receiver on a repeatable landmark. Set the RTK Facet to log RAWX data for 10 hours, convert to RINEX, run through an observation processing station and youâ€™ll get the corrected position with <10mm accuracy. Please see the [How to Build a DIY GNSS Reference Station](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-build-a-diy-gnss-reference-station) tutorial for more information.
* Option 3 allows a user to set the max logging length in minutes. Every 'max long length' amount of time the current log will be closed and a new log will be started. This is known as cyclic logging and is convenient on *very* long surveys (ie, months or years) to prevent logs from getting too unwieldy and helps limit the risk of log corruption. This will continue until the unit is powered down or the *max logging time* is reached.
* Option 4 will enable/disable creating a comma separated file (Marks_date.csv) that is written each time the mark state is selected with the setup button on the RTK Surveyor, RTK Express or RTK Express Plus, or the power button on the RTK Facet.
* Option 5 will enable/disable the SD card server which provides access to the microSD card via WiFi in Rover and Base modes.  In Rover mode the NTRIP client must be enabled.  In Base mode the NTRIP server must be enabled, and it is possible to enable WiFi during Survey-In mode.  The SD card server is always available in WiFi Config mode.

**Note:** If you are wanting to log RAWX sentences to create RINEX files useful for post processing the position of the receiver please see the GNSS Configuration Menu. For more information on how to use a RAWX GNSS log to get higher accuracy base location please see the [How to Build a DIY GNSS Reference Station](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-build-a-diy-gnss-reference-station#gather-raw-gnss-data) tutorial.
