While we recommend SW Maps for Android, there are a variety of 3rd party apps available for GIS and surveying. We will cover a few examples below that should give you an idea of how to get the incoming NMEA data over Bluetooth into the software of your choice.

## SW Maps

The best mobile app that we’ve found is the powerful, free, and easy-to-use _SW Maps_](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=np.com.softwel.swmaps)* by Softwel. You’ll need an Android phone or tablet with Bluetooth. What makes SW Maps truly powerful is its built-in NTRIP client. This is a fancy way of saying that we’ll be showing you how to get RTCM correction data over the cellular network. 

Be sure your device is [paired over Bluetooth](https://sparkfun.github.io/SparkFun_RTK_Firmware/connecting_bluetooth/#android).


![List of BT Devices in SW Maps](img/SparkFun%20RTK%20SWMaps%20Bluetooth%20Connect.png)

*List of available Bluetooth devices*

From SW Map's main menu, select *Bluetooth GNSS*. This will display a list of available Bluetooth devices. Select the Rover or Base you just paired with. If you are taking height measurements (altitude) in addition to position (lat/long) be sure to enter the height of your antenna off the ground including any [ARP offsets](https://geodesy.noaa.gov/ANTCAL/FAQ.xhtml#faq4) of your antenna (this should be printed on the side).

Click on 'CONNECT' to open a Bluetooth connection. Assuming this process takes a few seconds, you should immediately have a location fix.

![SW Maps with RTK Fix](img/SparkFun%20RTK%20SWMaps%20GNSS%20Status.png)

*SW Maps with RTK Fix*

You can open the GNSS Status sub-menu to view the current data.

**NTRIP Client**

If you’re using a serial radio to connect a Base to a Rover for your correction data, or if you're using the RTK Facet L-Band with built-in corrections, you can skip this part.

We need to send RTCM correction data from the phone back to the RTK device so that it can improve its fix accuracy. This is the amazing power of the SparkFun RTK products and SW Maps. Your phone can be the radio link! From the main SW Maps menu select NTRIP Client. Not there? Be sure the 'SparkFun RTK' instrument was automatically selected connecting. Disconnect and change the instrument to 'SparkFun RTK' to enable the NTRIP Connection option.

*Connecting to an NTRIP Caster*

Enter your NTRIP Caster credentials and click connect. You will see bytes begin to transfer from your phone to the RTK Express. Within a few seconds, the RTK Express will go from ~300mm accuracy to 14mm. Pretty nifty, no?

What's an NTRIP Caster? In a nutshell, it's a server that is sending out correction data every second. There are thousands of sites around the globe that calculate the perturbations in the ionosphere and troposphere that decrease the accuracy of GNSS accuracy. Once the inaccuracies are known, correction values are encoded into data packets in the RTCM format. You, the user, don't need to know how to decode or deal with RTCM, you simply need to get RTCM from a source within 10km of your location into the RTK Express. The NTRIP client logs into the server (also known as the NTRIP caster) and grabs that data, every second, and sends it over Bluetooth to the RTK Express.

Don't have access to an NTRIP Caster? You can use a 2nd RTK product operating in Base mode to provide the correction data. Checkout [Creating a Permanent Base](https://sparkfun.github.io/SparkFun_RTK_Firmware/permanent_base/). If you're the DIY sort, you can create your own low-cost base station using an ESP32 and a ZED-F9P breakout board. Check out [How to](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-build-a-diy-gnss-reference-station) Build a DIY GNSS Reference Station](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-build-a-diy-gnss-reference-station). If you'd just like a service, [Syklark](https://www.swiftnav.com/skylark) provides RTCM coverage for $49 a month (as of writing) and is extremely easy to set up and use. Remember, you can always use a 2nd RTK device in *Base* mode to provide RTCM correction data but it will be less accurate than a fixed position caster.

Once you have a full RTK fix you'll notice the location bubble in SW Maps turns green. Just for fun, rock your rover monopole back and forth on a fixed point. You'll see your location accurately reflected in SW Maps. Millimeter location precision is a truly staggering thing.

## Field Genius

[Field Genius for Android](https://www.microsurvey.com/products/fieldgenius-for-android/) is another good solution, albeit a lot more expensive than free.

![Server and mount point selected](img/SurveyMaster/SparkFun%20RTK%20Survey%20Master%20-%2009.png)

Return to the 'Datalink type' window and select the Server you just entered. Re-enter the server address and port for your NTRIP Caster. Once complete, click on the down-pointing arrow. This will ping the Caster and obtain the mount point table. Select your mount point.

![Rover with work list in place](img/SurveyMaster/SparkFun%20RTK%20Survey%20Master%20-%2011.png)

Select the newly created work mode and press the 'Apply' button.

![Connecting to service](img/SurveyMaster/SparkFun%20RTK%20Survey%20Master%20-%2033.png)

Survey Master will attempt to connect to your specified RTK corrections source (NTRIP Caster). Upon success, you will be located on the Project menu.

Survey Master expects many more NMEA sentences than most GIS software. We must enable some additional messages on the RTK device to correctly communicate with Survey Master. 

![Configured NMEA messages](img/SurveyMaster/SparkFun%20RTK%20Survey%20Master%20-%2026%20.jpg)

Note above: There are 9 enabled messages and GSV is set to '1'.

Connect to the RTK device either over [WiFi AP config](/configure_with_wifi/) or via [Serial](/configure_with_serial/). Above is shown the serial method.

Open a terminal at 115200bps and press a key to open the serial configuration menu. Press '2' for GNSS Messages, press '1' for NMEA messages, now be sure to enable 9 messages to a rate of 1:

* GGA
* GLL
* GRS
* GSA
* GST
* GSV
* RMC
* VTG
* ZDA

Once complete, press x until you exit the serial menus. Now we may return to Survey Master.

![Survey Master showing the location of RTK Express](img/SurveyMaster/SparkFun%20RTK%20Survey%20Master%20-%2025.png)

Click on the 'Survey' menu and then 'Topo Survey'. Above we can see a device with RTK float, and 117mm horizontal positional accuracy.

Known Issues:

* Survey Master parses the GxGSV sentence improperly and will only indicate GPS satellites even though the fix solution is using all satellites.

![NMEA Sentences](img/SurveyMaster/SparkFun%20RTK%20Survey%20Master%20-%2015.png)

To verify the NMEA sentences are being delivered correctly, Survey Master has a built-in tool. Select the Device->Rover->More->'H-Terminal'. 

## Other
Hopefully, these examples give you an idea of how to connect the RTK product line to most any GIS software. If there is other GIS software that you'd like to see configuration information about, please open an issue on the [RTK Firmware repo](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_RTK_Firmware/issues) and we'll add it.
