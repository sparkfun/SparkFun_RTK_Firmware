*User Profiles Menu*

Profiles are a very powerful feature. A profile is a complete copy of all the settings on the RTK product. Switching profiles changes all the settings in one step. This is handy for creating a complex setup for surveying, and a different setup for an NTRIP-enabled base station. Rather than changing the variety of parameters, a user can simply switch profiles.

*Multiple Profiles on Menu*

If more than one profile is defined, the profiles will be displayed and selectable by using the **Power/Setup** on the Facet or **Setup** on the Express and Express Plus. Profiles can be named up to 50 characters; only the first 7 characters will be shown on the menu.

## Surveyor Profiles

Because the Surveyor does not have a display, profiles are not available. The Base/Rover switch allows simple pre-set configurations to be toggled.
