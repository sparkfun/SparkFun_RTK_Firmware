While we recommend [SW Maps for Android](gis_software_android/#sw-maps), there are a variety of 3rd party apps available for GIS and surveying for [Android](gis_software_android.md), [iOS](gis_software_ios.md), and [Windows](gis_software_windows.md). We will cover a few examples below that should give you an idea of how to get the incoming NMEA data into the software of your choice.

## ArcGIS Field Maps

[ArcGIS Field Maps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.esri.fieldmaps&hl=en_US) by Esri is a popular GIS app. Unfortunately it does not have a built in NTRIP Client to allow high precision corrections down to the RTK device. To enable high-precision, a [mock location](connecting_bluetooth.md/#enable-mock-location) and an intermediary app such as [GNSS Master](gis_software_android.md/#gnss-master) or [Lefebure](gis_software_android.md/#lefebure) is needed.

Once a [mock location](connecting_bluetooth.md/#enable-mock-location) provider is setup, open Field Maps.

![Field Maps main menu](<img/FieldMaps/SparkFun RTK Field Maps - Main.png>)

Select **World Imagery**.

![ArcGIS Field Maps with 12mm accuracy](<img/FieldMaps/SparkFun RTK Field Maps - RTK Fix.png>)

*ArcGIS Field Maps with 12mm accuracy*

Field Maps will use the device's internal location as its default location provider. With GNSS Master or Lefebure providing the mock location to the phone, Field Maps will have a super precise GNSS location and data collection can begin.

## ArcGIS QuickCapture

[ArcGIS QuickCapture](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.esri.arcgisquickcapture&hl=en_US) by Esri is a popular GIS app. Unfortunately it does not allow Bluetooth connections to 3rd party RTK devices. To enable a connection to a SparkFun RTK device, a [mock location](connecting_bluetooth.md/#enable-mock-location) and an intermediary app such as [GNSS Master](gis_software_android.md/#gnss-master) or [Lefebure](gis_software_android.md/#lefebure) is needed.

Once a [mock location](connecting_bluetooth.md/#enable-mock-location) provider is setup, open QuickCapture.

![QuickCapture Main Window](<img/QuickCapture/SparkFun RTK QuickCapture - Main Window.png>)

For the purposes of this demonstration, click *Continue without signing in*.

![Add project button](<img/QuickCapture/SparkFun RTK QuickCapture - Workspace.png>)

![BioBlitz options](<img/QuickCapture/SparkFun RTK QuickCapture - BioBlitz.png>)

From the BioBlitz project screen we can see we have a GPS accuracy of less than 1 ft. The RTK device has RTK fix and is providing extremely accurate (better than 20mm or 1") positional data.

Click the map icon in the upper right.

![BioBlitz Map](<img/QuickCapture/SparkFun RTK QuickCapture - BioBlitz Map.png>)

The location of the receiver is shown on a map. With GNSS Master or Lefebure providing the mock location to the phone, QuickCapture will have a very precise GNSS location and data collection can begin.

## ArcGIS Survey123

[ArcGIS Survey123](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.esri.survey123&hl=en_US) by Esri is a popular GIS app. Unfortunately it does not allow Bluetooth connections to 3rd party RTK devices. To enable a connection to a SparkFun RTK device, a [mock location](connecting_bluetooth.md/#enable-mock-location) and an intermediary app such as [GNSS Master](gis_software_android.md/#gnss-master) or [Lefebure](gis_software_android.md/#lefebure) is needed.

Once a [mock location](connecting_bluetooth.md/#enable-mock-location) provider is setup, open Survey123.

![Survey123 Splash](<img/Survey123/SparkFun RTK Survey123 - Splash.png>)

For the purposes of this demonstration, click *Continue without signing in*.

![Main window](<img/Survey123/SparkFun RTK Survey123 - Main.png>)

Closing the GPS Source window will show the map as well as the relative accuracy in feet. 

## Field Genius

[Field Genius for Android](https://www.microsurvey.com/products/fieldgenius-for-android/) is another good solution, albeit a lot more expensive than free. 

Be sure your device is [paired over Bluetooth](connecting_bluetooth.md#android).

![Main Menu](img/FieldGenius/Field%20Genius%202.png)

From the Main Menu open `Select Instrument`.

![Add Profile](img/FieldGenius/Field%20Genius%203.png)

Click the 'Add Profile' button.

![New Instrument Profile](img/FieldGenius/Field%20Genius%204.png)

![Set up communication](img/FieldGenius/Field%20Genius%205.png)

Click on 'SET UP COMMUNICATION'.

![Bluetooth Search Button](img/FieldGenius/Field%20Genius%207.png)

From the Bluetooth communication page, click the 'Search' button.

![List of paired Bluetooth devices](img/FieldGenius/Field%20Genius%206.png)

You will be shown a list of paired devices. Select the RTK device you'd like to connect to then click 'Connect'. The RTK device will connect and the MAC address shown on the RTK device OLED will change to the Bluetooth icon indicating a link is open.

**NTRIP Client**

If you’re using a serial radio to connect a Base to a Rover for your correction data, or if you're using the RTK Facet L-Band with built-in corrections, you can skip this part.

![Set up corrections](img/FieldGenius/Field%20Genius%208.png)

We need to send RTCM correction data from the phone back to the RTK device so that it can improve its fix accuracy. Your phone can be the radio link! Click on 'SET UP CORRECTIONS'.

![RTK via Internet](img/FieldGenius/Field%20Genius%209.png)

Click on 'RTK via Internet' then 'SET UP INTERNET', then 'Done'.

![Set up NTRIP data source](img/FieldGenius/Field%20Genius%2010.png)

Click on 'SET UP DATA SOURCE'.

![Adding a new source](img/FieldGenius/Field%20Genius%2011.png)

Click 'Add New Source'.

![NTRIP Credential Entry](img/FieldGenius/Field%20Genius%2012.png)

Enter your NTRIP Caster credentials and click 'DONE'. 

What's an NTRIP Caster? In a nutshell, it's a server that is sending out correction data every second. There are thousands of sites around the globe that calculate the perturbations in the ionosphere and troposphere that decrease the accuracy of GNSS accuracy. Once the inaccuracies are known, correction values are encoded into data packets in the RTCM format. You, the user, don't need to know how to decode or deal with RTCM, you simply need to get RTCM from a source within 10km of your location into the RTK device. The NTRIP client logs into the server (also known as the NTRIP caster) and grabs that data, every second, and sends it over Bluetooth to the RTK device.

Don't have access to an NTRIP Caster? You can use a 2nd RTK product operating in Base mode to provide the correction data. Check out [Creating a Permanent Base](permanent_base.md). If you're the DIY sort, you can create your own low-cost base station using an ESP32 and a ZED-F9P breakout board. Check out [How to Build a DIY GNSS Reference Station](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-build-a-diy-gnss-reference-station). If you'd just like a service, [Syklark](https://www.swiftnav.com/skylark) provides RTCM coverage for $49 a month (as of writing) and is extremely easy to set up and use. Remember, you can always use a 2nd RTK device in *Base* mode to provide RTCM correction data but it will be less accurate than a fixed position caster.

![Selecting data source](img/FieldGenius/Field%20Genius%2011.png)

Click 'My NTRIP1' then 'Done' and 'Connect'. 

You will then be presented with a list of Mount Points. Select the mount point you'd like to use then click 'Select' then 'Confirm'.

Select 'Done' then from the main menu select 'Survey' to begin using the device.

![Surveying Screen](img/FieldGenius/Field%20Genius%201.png)

Now you can begin using the SparkFun RTK device with Field Genius.

## GNSS Master

[GNSS Master](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gnssmaster&hl=en_US) is a great utility when a given GIS app does not have an NTRIP Client or a way to connect over Bluetooth. GNSS Master connects to a RTK device over Bluetooth (or Bluetooth BLE) as well as any correction source (NTRIP, PointPerfect, even USB Serial), and then acts as the phone's location using [Mock Location](connecting_bluetooth.md/#enable-mock-location).

**Note:** Most GIS apps will not need GNSS Master or Mock Location enabled and this section can be skipped.

Read how to [Enable Mock Location](connecting_bluetooth.md/#enable-mock-location).

![GNSS Master main menu](<img/GNSSMaster/SparkFun RTK GNSS Master - Main.png>)

From the GNSS Master main screen, select **GNSS Receiver Connection**.

![GNSS Receiver Selection](<img/GNSSMaster/SparkFun RTK GNSS Master - Receiver Selection.png>)

Pick the RTK device to connect to from the list, then click *Connect*. The **Data Rate** should increase indicating data flowing from the RTK device to the GNSS Master app. Click the back button to return to the main screen.

![Correction Input](<img/GNSSMaster/SparkFun RTK GNSS Master - Correction Input.png>)

Select **Correction Input** to setup an NTRIP Client.

![Corrections List](<img/GNSSMaster/SparkFun RTK GNSS Master - Correction Source List.png>)

This is one of the powerful features of GNSS Master - multiple connections can be entered. This is helpful if you regularly switch between locations or NTRIP Casters and your GIS software only allows entry of a single NTRIP source. GNSS Master supports corrections from NTRIP Casters but also PointPerfect and a direct serial connection to a GNSS receiver. This can be really helpful in advanced setups.

![NTRIP Client information](<img/GNSSMaster/SparkFun RTK GNSS Master - NTRIP Client Input.png>)

Enter your NTRIP Client information then click **SAVE**.

![Data from Caster](<img/GNSSMaster/SparkFun RTK GNSS Master - Correction Source Data Flowing.png>)

Once connected the *Data Rate* should increase above 0 bytes per second.  Return to the home screen by hitting the back button.

![Enable Mock Location](<img/GNSSMaster/SparkFun RTK GNSS Master - Mock Location.png>)

Enable mock location. If GNSS Master throws an error, re-enable GNSS Master as your [Mock Location provider](connecting_bluetooth.md/#enable-mock-location) in Developer Options.

Once enabled, any GIS app that selects 'Internal' or 'Phone Location' as its source will instead be fed the high precision NMEA being generated by the RTK device connected over Bluetooth.

## Lefebure 

[Lefebure NTRIP Client](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lefebure.ntripclient&hl=en_US) is the *original* app for getting correction from an NTRIP caster and down over Bluetooth. It's an oldie but a goodie.

**Note:** Most GIS apps will not need Lefebure or Mock Location enabled and this section can be skipped.

The problem is that if Lefebure is connected to the RTK device providing RTCM corrections over Bluetooth, then other GIS applications cannot use the same Bluetooth connection at the same time. That's where mock locations save the day. Lefebure can be setup to take over or 'mock' the GPS location being reported by the phone. Nearly all GIS apps can use the phone's GPS location. So if the phone's location is magically super precise, then Lefebure can be the NTRIP Client and data provide, and your GIS app is none the wiser, and uses the phone's location.

Read how to [Enable Mock Location](connecting_bluetooth.md/#enable-mock-location).

![LEfebure settings](<img/Lefebure/SparkFun RTK Lefebure - Main.png>)

Once mock locations are enabled, click on the *Settings* gear in the top left corner.

![NTRIP Settings](<img/Lefebure/SparkFun RTK Lefebure - NTRIP Settings.png>)

If needed, an NTRIP Client can be setup to provide corrections over Bluetooth to the RTK device.

![NTRIP Client Settings](<img/Lefebure/SparkFun RTK Lefebure - NTRIP Client Settings.png>)

Enter the Caster information and hit the back button.

![Receive Settings](<img/Lefebure/SparkFun RTK Lefebure - Receiver Settings.png>)

Select *Receiver Settings*.

![Bluetooth and Mock location enable](<img/Lefebure/SparkFun RTK Lefebure - Receiver Settings Bluetooth.png>)

Select the RTK device that has been paired over Bluetooth. Also enable Mock Locations. Hit the back button to return to the main screen.

![alt text](<img/Lefebure/SparkFun RTK Lefebure - Getting Data with Mock Location.png>)

Press the **Connect** button. The app will connect to the NTRIP Caster. Now, any GIS app that selects 'Internal' or 'Phone Location' as its source will instead be fed the high precision NMEA being generated by the RTK device connected over Bluetooth.

## QField

![Opening page of QField](img/QField/SparkFun%20RTK%20QField%20-%20Open%20Project.png)

[QField](https://docs.qfield.org/get-started/) is a free GIS Android app that runs QGIS.

![NMEA message configuration](img/WiFi Config/RTK_Surveyor_-_WiFi_Config_-_GNSS_Config_Messages.jpg)

*The 'Reset to Surveying Defaults' button*

First, configure the RTK device to output *only* NMEA messages. QField currently does not correctly parse other messages such as RAWX or RTCM so these will interfere with communication if they are enabled.

These RTK device settings can be found under the [Messages menu](menu_messages.md) through the [WiFi config page](configure_with_wifi.md) or through the [Serial Config menu](configure_with_serial.md).

![Server and mount point selected](img/SurveyMaster/SparkFun%20RTK%20Survey%20Master%20-%2009.png)

Return to the 'Datalink type' window and select the Server you just entered. Re-enter the server address and port for your NTRIP Caster. Once complete, click on the down-pointing arrow. This will ping the Caster and obtain the mount point table. Select your mount point.

![Rover with work list in place](img/SurveyMaster/SparkFun%20RTK%20Survey%20Master%20-%2011.png)

Select the newly created work mode and press the 'Apply' button.

![Connecting to service](img/SurveyMaster/SparkFun%20RTK%20Survey%20Master%20-%2033.png)

Survey Master will attempt to connect to your specified RTK corrections source (NTRIP Caster). Upon success, you will be located on the Project menu.

Survey Master expects many more NMEA sentences than most GIS software. We must enable some additional messages on the RTK device to correctly communicate with Survey Master. 

![Configured NMEA messages](img/SurveyMaster/SparkFun%20RTK%20Survey%20Master%20-%2026%20.jpg)

Note above: There are 9 enabled messages and GSV is set to '1'.

Connect to the RTK device either over [WiFi AP config](/configure_with_wifi/) or via [Serial](/configure_with_serial/). Above is shown the serial method.

Open a terminal at 115200bps and press a key to open the serial configuration menu. Press '2' for GNSS Messages, press '1' for NMEA messages, now be sure to enable 9 messages to a rate of 1:

* GGA
* GLL
* GRS
* GSA
* GST
* GSV
* RMC
* VTG
* ZDA

Once complete, press x until you exit the serial menus. Now we may return to Survey Master.

![Survey Master showing the location of RTK Express](img/SurveyMaster/SparkFun%20RTK%20Survey%20Master%20-%2025.png)

Click on the 'Survey' menu and then 'Topo Survey'. Above we can see a device with RTK float, and 117mm horizontal positional accuracy.

Known Issues:

* Survey Master parses the GxGSV sentence improperly and will only indicate GPS satellites even though the fix solution is using all satellites.

![NMEA Sentences](img/SurveyMaster/SparkFun%20RTK%20Survey%20Master%20-%2015.png)

To verify the NMEA sentences are being delivered correctly, Survey Master has a built-in tool. Select the Device->Rover->More->'H-Terminal'. 

## SurPad

[SurPad](https://surpadapp.com/) is an Android app available as a free trial for 30-days. It's loaded as an APK (rather than through Google Play).

*Receiver Submenu*

You are welcome to enter the ARP (antenna reference point) and surveying stick length for your particular setup.

**NTRIP Client**

Note: If you are using a radio to connect Base to Rover, or if you are using the RTK Facet L-Band you do not need to set up NTRIP; the device will achieve RTK fixes and output extremely accurate location data by itself. But if L-Band corrections are not available, or you are not using a radio link, the NTRIP Client can provide corrections to this Rover.

![RTK Submenu](img/SurvPC/SparkFun%20RTK%20Software%20-%20SurvPC%20NTRIP%20Client.jpg)

*RTK Submenu*

If you selected 'DGPS' as the Model type, the RTK submenu will be shown. This is where you give the details about your NTRIP Caster such as your mount point, user name/pw, etc. For more information about creating your own NTRIP mount point please see [Creating a Permanent Base](permanent_base.md)

Enter your NTRIP Caster credentials and click connect. You will see bytes begin to transfer from your phone to the RTK device. Within a few seconds, the RTK device will go from ~300mm accuracy to 14mm. Pretty nifty, no?

What's an NTRIP Caster? In a nutshell, it's a server that is sending out correction data every second. There are thousands of sites around the globe that calculate the perturbations in the ionosphere and troposphere that decrease the accuracy of GNSS accuracy. Once the inaccuracies are known, correction values are encoded into data packets in the RTCM format. You, the user, don't need to know how to decode or deal with RTCM, you simply need to get RTCM from a source within 10km of your location into the RTK device. The NTRIP client logs into the server (also known as the NTRIP caster) and grabs that data, every second, and sends it over Bluetooth to the RTK device.

Don't have access to an NTRIP Caster? You can use a 2nd RTK product operating in Base mode to provide the correction data. Checkout [Creating a Permanent Base](permanent_base.md). If you're the DIY sort, you can create your own low-cost base station using an ESP32 and a ZED-F9P breakout board. Check out [How to](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-build-a-diy-gnss-reference-station) Build a DIY GNSS Reference Station](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-build-a-diy-gnss-reference-station). If you'd just like a service, [Syklark](https://www.swiftnav.com/skylark) provides RTCM coverage for $49 a month (as of writing) and is extremely easy to set up and use. Remember, you can always use a 2nd RTK device in *Base* mode to provide RTCM correction data but it will be less accurate than a fixed position caster.

Once everything is connected up, click the Green check in the top right corner.

## SW Maps

The best mobile app that we’ve found is the powerful, free, and easy-to-use [SW Maps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=np.com.softwel.swmaps) by Softwel. It is compatible with Android and iOS, either phone or tablet with Bluetooth. What makes SW Maps truly powerful is its built-in NTRIP client. This is a fancy way of saying that we’ll be showing you how to get RTCM correction data over the cellular network. 

Be sure your device is [paired over Bluetooth](connecting_bluetooth.md#android).

![List of BT Devices in SW Maps](img/SWMaps/SparkFun%20RTK%20SWMaps%20Bluetooth%20Connect.png)

*List of available Bluetooth devices*

From SW Map's main menu, select *Bluetooth GNSS*. This will display a list of available Bluetooth devices. Select the Rover or Base you just paired with. If you are taking height measurements (altitude) in addition to position (lat/long) be sure to enter the height of your antenna off the ground including any [ARP offsets](https://geodesy.noaa.gov/ANTCAL/FAQ.xhtml#faq4) of your antenna (this should be printed on the side).

Click on 'CONNECT' to open a Bluetooth connection. Assuming this process takes a few seconds, you should immediately have a location fix.

![SW Maps with RTK Fix](img/SWMaps/SparkFun%20RTK%20SWMaps%20GNSS%20Status.png)

*SW Maps with RTK Fix*

You can open the GNSS Status sub-menu to view the current data.

**NTRIP Client**

If you’re using a serial radio to connect a Base to a Rover for your correction data, or if you're using the RTK Facet L-Band with built-in corrections, you can skip this part.

We need to send RTCM correction data from the phone back to the RTK device so that it can improve its fix accuracy. This is the amazing power of the SparkFun RTK products and SW Maps. Your phone can be the radio link! From the main SW Maps menu select NTRIP Client. Not there? Be sure the 'SparkFun RTK' instrument was automatically selected connecting. Disconnect and change the instrument to 'SparkFun RTK' to enable the NTRIP Connection option.

![SW Maps NTRIP Connection menu](img/SWMaps/SparkFun_RTK_Surveyor_-_SW_Maps_NTRIP_Connection.jpg)

*NTRIP Connection - Not there? Be sure to select 'SparkFun RTK' was selected as the instrument*

![SW Maps NTRIP client](img/SWMaps/SW_Maps_-_NTRIP_Client.jpg)

*Connecting to an NTRIP Caster*

Enter your NTRIP Caster credentials and click connect. You will see bytes begin to transfer from your phone to the RTK device. Within a few seconds, the RTK device will go from ~300mm accuracy to 14mm. Pretty nifty, no?

Once you have a full RTK fix you'll notice the location bubble in SW Maps turns green. Just for fun, rock your rover monopole back and forth on a fixed point. You'll see your location accurately reflected in SW Maps. Millimeter location precision is a truly staggering thing.

## Vespucci

[Vespucci](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.blau.android&hl=en_US&gl=US) is an Open Street Map editor for Android.

This software requires the RTK device to connect over TCP. Be sure you have a local WiFi network entered into the [WiFi Config menu](menu_wifi.md), have a TCP Client or Server enabled, and have noted the TCP port (it's 2948 by default).

![Vespucci Gear Button](img/Vespucci/SparkFun%20RTK%20Vespucci%20-%20Main%20Gear.png)

With a map open, select the gear icon on the bottom bar.

![Vespucci Preferences menu](img/Vespucci/SparkFun%20RTK%20Vespucci%20-%20Preferences.png)

From the Preferences menu, scroll to the bottom and select 'Advanced Preferences'.

![Preferences menu showing Location Settings](img/Vespucci/SparkFun%20RTK%20Vespucci%20-%20Location%20Settings.png)

Select **Location settings**.

![GPS source menu](img/Vespucci/SparkFun%20RTK%20Vespucci%20-%20GPS%20Source.png)

Select **GPS/GNSS source**. Select **NMEA from TCP client**. TCP server is also supported.

![Vespucci NMEA network source menu](img/Vespucci/SparkFun%20RTK%20Vespucci%20-%20NMEA%20Network%20Source.png)

Select **NMEA network source**. Enter the IP address and TCP port of the RTK device. The IP address can be found by opening a serial terminal while connected to WiFi (it is reported every few seconds). The TCP port is entered into the [WiFi Config menu](menu_wifi.md).

![Vespucci showing location on map](img/Vespucci/SparkFun%20RTK%20Vespucci%20-%20Point%20on%20Map.png)

Close all menus and you should see your location within Vespucci.

## Other GIS Packages

Hopefully, these examples give you an idea of how to connect the RTK product line to most any GIS software. If there is other GIS software that you'd like to see configuration information about, please open an issue on the [RTK Firmware repo](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_RTK_Everywhere_Firmware/issues) and we'll add it.

## Where do I get RTK Corrections?

Be sure to see [Correction Sources](correction_sources.md). 

Don't have access to an NTRIP Caster or other RTCM correction source? There are a few options.

The [SparkFun RTK Facet L-Band](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/20000) gets corrections via an encrypted signal from geosynchronous satellites. This device gets RTK Fix without the need for a WiFi or cellular connection.

Also, you can use a 2nd RTK product operating in Base mode to provide the correction data. Check out [Creating a Permanent Base](permanent_base.md). 

If you're the DIY sort, you can create your own low-cost base station using an ESP32 and a ZED-F9P breakout board. Check out [How to Build a DIY GNSS Reference Station](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-build-a-diy-gnss-reference-station). 

There are services available as well. [Syklark](https://www.swiftnav.com/skylark) provides RTCM coverage for $49 a month (as of writing) and is extremely easy to set up and use. [Point One](https://app.pointonenav.com/trial?utm_source=sparkfun) also offers RTK NTRIP service with a free 14 day trial and easy to use front end.
