Starting with firmware v1.7, WiFi-based configuration is supported. For more information about updating the firmware on your device, please see [Updating RTK Firmware](https://sparkfun.github.io/SparkFun_RTK_Firmware/firmware_update/).

The RTK device will present a webpage that is viewable from either a desktop/laptop with WiFi or a cell phone. For advanced configurations, a desktop is recommended. For quick in-field changes, a cell phone works great.

## Connecting to WiFi Network

Note: Upon connecting, your phone may warn you that this WiFi network has no internet. That's ok. Stay connected to the network and open a browser. If you still have problems turn off Mobile Data so that the phone does not default to cellular for internet connectivity and instead connects to the RTK Device.

*Connected to the RTK WiFi Setup Page*

Clicking on the category 'carrot' will open or close that section. Clicking on an ‘i’ will give you a brief description of the options within that section.

*This unit has firmware version 1.8 and a ZED-F9P receiver*

Please note that the firmware for the RTK device and the firmware for the ZED receiver is shown at the top of the page. This can be helpful when troubleshooting or requesting new features.

## Saving and Exit

[![Save and Exit buttons](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/4/6/3/RTK_Surveyor_-_WiFi_Config_-_System_Save_Exit.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/4/6/3/RTK_Surveyor_-_WiFi_Config_-_System_Save_Exit.jpg)

Once settings are input, please press ‘Save Configuration’. This will validate any settings, show any errors that need adjustment, and send the settings to the unit. The page will remain active until the user presses ‘Exit to Rover Mode’ at which point the unit will exit WiFi configuration and return to standard Rover mode.
