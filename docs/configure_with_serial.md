To configure an RTK device using serial attach a [USB C cable](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15425) to the device. The device can be on or off.

## RTK Surveyor / Express / Express+

*The SparkFun RTK Surveyor has a variety of connectors*

Connect the USB cable to the connector labeled **Config ESP32**.

Once connected a COM port will enumerate. Open the `Device Manager` in Windows and look under the Ports branch to see what COM port the device is assigned to.

## RTK Facet

Connect the USB cable to the USB connector.

There is a USB hub built into the RTK Facet. When you attach the device to your computer it will enumerate two COM ports.

In the image above, the `USB Serial Device` is the ZED-F9P and the `USB-SERIAL CH340` is the ESP32.

**Don't See 'USB-Serial CH340'?** If you've never connected a CH340 device to your computer before, you may need to install drivers for the USB-to-serial converter. Check out our section on <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sparkfun-serial-basic-ch340c-hookup-guide#drivers-if-you-need-them">"How to Install CH340 Drivers"</a> for help with the installation.

**Don't See 'USB Serial Device'?** The first time a u-blox module is connected to a computer you may need to adjust the COM driver. Check out our section on <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-u-center-for-u-blox#install-drivers">"How to Install u-blox Drivers"</a> for help with the installation.

Configuring the RTK device is done over the *USB-Serial CH340* COM port via the serial text menu. Various debug messages are printed to this port at 115200bps and a serial menu can be opened to configure advanced settings. 

Configuring the ZED-F9P is done over the *USB Serial Device* port using [u-center](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-u-center-for-u-blox/all). Itâ€™s not necessary for normal operation but is handy for tailoring the receiver to specific applications. As an added perk, the ZED-F9P can be detected automatically by some mobile phones and tablets. If desired, the receiver can be directly connected to a compatible phone or tablet removing the need for a Bluetooth connection.

## Terminal Window

Open a terminal window at 115200bps; you should see various status messages every second. Press any key to open the configuration menu. Not sure how to use a terminal? Check out our [Serial](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/terminal-basics) Terminal Basics](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/terminal-basics) tutorial.

*Main Menu*

Pressing any button will display the Main menu. The Main menu will display the current firmware version and the Bluetooth broadcast name. Note: When powered on, the RTK device will broadcast itself as either *[Platform] Rover-XXXX* or *[Platform] Base-XXXX* depending on which state it is in. The Platform is 'Facet', 'Express', 'Surveyor', etc.
